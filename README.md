## Project Structure

This `README.md` gives an overview of the project structure and instructions on how to build and deploy the application.

## Features

**SOAP Web Service**: Exposes a `getHoroscope()` method to retrieve daily horoscope and store it in the database.

## Getting Started

![Project Codes & Tasks](/img/code.jpg "Project Codes and Task")

---

### Prerequisites

>- **Apache TomEE 10**: is the application server used during development, but any Jakarta EE 10-compliant server should work.
>- **Java 23**: Ensure you have Java 23 installed as TomEE 10 targets Jakarta EE 10.
>- **Maven**: The project uses Maven for dependency management with any IDE of choice.

### Dependencies

The required dependencies are defined in `pom.xml`. Below are the key dependencies:

- **Jakarta EE 10 API**: Provides JAX-WS support.
- **JAX-WS**: For SOAP web service implementation.

### Building and Running the Application

## Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aerosimo/astrology.git
    cd astrology
    ```

2. **Build the project using Maven**:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. **Deploy the WAR file**:

   After building the project, deploy the generated `WAR` file from the `target/` directory into the `webapps/` folder of your preferred Jakarta EE 10-compatible server.

4. **Start your preferred Jakarta EE 10-compatible server**:

   Start server and access the application:

    - SOAP Service: WSDL at `http://localhost:8081/astrology/ws/astrology?wsdl`
    - Web Interface: `http://localhost:8081/astrology/index.jsp`

## Detailed Explanation of Components

### 1. **SOAP Web Service** (JAX-WS)

The SOAP web service is implemented in `com.aerosimo.ominet.astrology.api.soap.Astrology.java`.

Example sendMail SOAP Request:
```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" xmlns:ast="https://aerosimo.com/api/ws/astrology">
    <soap:Header/>
    <soap:Body>
        <ast:sendEmail />
    </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```


```
